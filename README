This is the H4H7591 benchmark for automated reasoning in large theories (ARLT).


There are large 7591 problems in the benchmark in the directory
"problems". They are listed in the file ProblemsInProcessingOrder and
contain altogether 9263 formulas. The problems are created by
first-order export [1] of theorems and definitions from 67 HOL4 [2]
files, listed in FilesInProcessingOrder.

Only theories needed by the following four theories that cover 2/3 of
the HOL4 standard library are included in the benchmark:

- probability 
- complex 
- integral
- ratRing

4216 of these large problems could be proved by the Vampire 4.0 ATP
system either from its original HOL4 proof dependencies or with axiom
selection using the k-nearest neighbor machine learning method [1]
trained on other proofs.  All these 4216 proofs are available in the
directory proofs.
